# FredChatBot

FredChatBot is an AI-powered chatbot built using Azure QnA Maker, React, and an API powered by Azure Functions. It is designed to provide users with interactive and informative conversations by leveraging a knowledge base of predefined questions and answers.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Responses** – Uses Azure QnA Maker to generate intelligent and context-aware replies.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and intuitive chat experience.
- **Achievements System** – Users earn visual achievements based on their interactions.
- **Azure Integration** – Hosted and managed within the Azure ecosystem.
- **API-Driven** – Uses an Azure Functions API to handle chatbot queries and responses.
- **React Frontend** – A responsive web interface built with React.

## How It Works

The chatbot uses a knowledge base created in Azure QnA Maker. Users submit queries through the React-based frontend, and the bot retrieves the most relevant response from the knowledge base using AI-powered natural language processing. The Azure Functions API acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the QnA Maker service.

## Future Enhancements

- Expanding the knowledge base for broader topic coverage.
- Improving response accuracy with additional AI models.
- Enhancing the chatbot’s UI for a more engaging experience.
